in 2012:

Adjusted sub sample Chaff wt. (g)
=(AS386-AU386)*$AN386
=( Sub sample Head dry wt (g)  - Sub sample Grain wt (g) ) * Drying correction factor


Adjusted Quadrat AR Dry wt (g)
=AZ386+BD386
= Adjusted total SS AR dry weight (g) + Adjusted Remainder sample AR Dry wt (g)


missing in 2011:
Adjusted sub sample Chaff wt. (g) 
Adjusted Quadrat AR Dry wt (g)
