# would you mind sending me data for the SB and tillering lines (either the raw or the averages with standard errors) on:
 
# Grain yield, with an estimate of area sampled and plant population (I’ll try to translate this in a per plant basis)
# Dry above-ground biomass at harvest, with number of spikes (again, as long as I know the units) and grain size (1000-grain weight)
# Dry above-ground biomass at anthesis, with leaf area, tiller numbers, spike number and SPAD data if available, and WSC concentration and content (i.e [] x stem weight) if you have it, otherwise I’m happy to write a line of code to calculate it.
