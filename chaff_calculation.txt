in 2012:

Adjusted sub sample Chaff wt. (g)
=(AS386-AU386)*$AN386
=( Sub sample Head dry wt (g)  - Sub sample Grain wt (g) ) * Drying correction factor


Adjusted Quadrat AR Dry wt (g)
=AZ386+BD386
= Adjusted total SS AR dry weight (g) + Adjusted Remainder sample AR Dry wt (g)

in 2011 at DC31:
Adjusted total SS AR dry weight (g) = 
Drying correction factor + Sub sample  Green Leaf dry Wt. (g)	+ Sub sample  Dead Leaf dry Wt. (g)	+ Sub sample Tiller dry Wt. (g)	+ Sub sample Pseudostem dry Wt. (g)	Sub sample Head dry Wt. (g)
