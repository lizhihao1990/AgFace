Methods
-------

Each leaf is placed in the leaf clip of the FieldSpec Pro (ASD instruments). First, a transmission spectrum from 350 to 2500 nm is measured of the leaf. The leaf is placed in fornt the white plate of the leaf clip . Then the same leaf is measured again in front of a black plate to get reflectance. The instrument was optimised based on the white reference plate. The same reference plate was used in the transmission measurements.

The reflectance and transmission spectra are normalised individually to be in the range of 0 to 1.
Leaf absorptivity is calculated from the normalised spectra asd

Abs = Reflectance - Transmission

The examples below show the results from a single leaf. This is just to clarify the actual data analysis process. There are no scientific results yet!
